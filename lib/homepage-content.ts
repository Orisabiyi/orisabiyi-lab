  body: `I'm Orisabiyi David; a software engineer, designer, and product thinker based in Nigeria. I thrive at the intersection of code, creativity,
          and curiosity, building digital experiences that are both thoughtful and functional.

          Since starting my journey in 2015, I've grown from creating static sites to engineering full-stack applications using modern tools like Next.js, TypeScript, NestJS, NodeJS TailwindCSS and many more. I care deeply about clean architecture, intuitive design, and writing performant, maintainable code.

          My long-term goal is to contribute to world-class products at a leading tech company solving meaningful problems at scale, collaborating with brilliant minds, and continuing to grow as a builder and thinker.

          When I'm not deep in code, I'm exploring design systems, experimenting with AI, or sharing my journey on Twitter and GitHub. Orisabiyi Lab is where I learn out loud, build boldly, and stay endlessly curious.`,
