  body: `I'm Orisabiyi David, a software engineer, designer, and product thinker based in Nigeria. I thrive at the intersection of code, creativity, and curiosity, building digital experiences that are both thoughtful and functional.

I began my journey in 2021, starting with beginner-friendly resources like Web Development for Dummies and The Odin Project. In 2022, I joined a tech empowerment program hosted by final-year students at my university a pivotal moment that truly launched my path into tech.

Since then, I've grown from building static sites to engineering full-stack applications using modern tools like Next.js, TypeScript, NestJS, Node.js, TailwindCSS, and more. I care deeply about clean architecture, intuitive design, and writing performant, maintainable code.

While I continue to sharpen my full-stack engineering skills, I'm also exploring new frontiers or skills from AI and product development to design systems always staying curious and open to what's next.

My long-term goal is to contribute to world-class products at a leading tech company, solving meaningful problems at scale, collaborating with brilliant minds, and continuing to grow as a builder and thinker.

When I'm not deep in code, I'm experimenting with design systems, exploring AI, or sharing my journey on Twitter and GitHub. Orisabiyi Lab is where I learn out loud, build boldly, and stay endlessly curious.`,
